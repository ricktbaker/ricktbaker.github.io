<p>This is my current pet project which is meant to help those that work with a number of AWS accounts. Always having to login to the console to find the server you want to connect to, if you need to use a bastion host, what key you need to use, etc.</p>

<p>This is still very early in the development phase. It has some rough edges for sure. It has been developed on a Mac, so your mileage may vary on other platforms. Currently there are no built downloads available. Once I get to a good solid base I will try and make Mac and Windows downloadables available. For now, if you have node installed, then you should be able to run/build on your own.</p>

<p>Primary Components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electron</li>
<li>Vue</li>
<li>XTerm.js</li>
<li>node-pty</li>
<li>Amazon SDK</li>
</ul>

<p>Add your AWS access keys per Organization and region (only needs ec2.describeInstances currently)</p>

<p>Scan for keys that are used for SSH access, and import them</p>

<p>Easily list out instances in regions you have setup</p>

<p>Setup a bastion host per region if you need to ssh into it first to access private ip servers behind</p>

<p>Easily connect via ssh to a server with the click of a button</p>

<h3 id="whats-to-come">What’s to come</h3>

<p>So much more.   Eventually would like to add regular server support, google cloud, etc.</p>

<p>Swap out node-pty for ssh2</p>

<p>Preferences, colors, styles, etc.</p>

<p>Ability to show more details about servers</p>

<p>Too much to list…</p>
