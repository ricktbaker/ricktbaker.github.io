<p>My name is Rick Baker.   I've been programming and doing linux server administration for about 20 years.   I started out in the 90s doing some basic website creation and things took off from there.</p>

<p>For the past 10 years I've been specializing in DevOps with a focus on AWS for the last 5 years.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with startups to help optimize their setups, reduce costs and position them in a good place to succeed from a technical standpoint.</p>
