# Opshell

This is my current pet project which is meant to help those that work with a number of AWS accounts. Always having to login to the console to find the server you want to connect to, if you need to use a bastion host, what key you need to use, etc.

This is still very early in the development phase. It has some rough edges for sure. It has been developed on a Mac, so your mileage may vary on other platforms. Currently there are no built downloads available. Once I get to a good solid base I will try and make Mac and Windows downloadables available. For now, if you have node installed, then you should be able to run/build on your own.

Primary Components: 
- Electron
- Vue
- XTerm.js
- node-pty
- Amazon SDK

#### Build Setup for Mac/Linux
``` bash
# install dependencies and native modules
./do_install.sh

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
npm run build
```

#### Build Setup for Windows

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# rebuild native modules
./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
yarn run dev

# build electron application for production
yarn run build
```


#### What is working thus far

Setup multipe organizations

Add your AWS access keys per Organization and region (only needs ec2.describeInstances currently)

Scan for keys that are used for SSH access, and import them

Easily list out instances in regions you have setup

Setup a bastion host per region if you need to ssh into it first to access private ip servers behind

Easily connect via ssh to a server with the click of a button

### What's to come

So much more.   Eventually would like to add regular server support, google cloud, etc.

Swap out node-pty for ssh2

Preferences, colors, styles, etc.

Ability to show more details about servers

Too much to list...
